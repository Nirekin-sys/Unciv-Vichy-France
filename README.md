* Uniques
  * National Regeneration [Ancien Regime]
  >As the scars of war, trauma and what is seen as degeneracy and backwardness sweeps over France, a call for a National Regeneration has been resounded in the halls of it's governing structure. Calling for a time when France was traditional, with merit and honour, of it's old days in pious glory.
  
  * Milice [Replaces Great War Infantry]
  >The Milice, French for Militia, is a paramilitary domestic force that specializes in the elimination of threats in the home front. Historically charged with combatting internal unrest and guerilla groups from the underground, what made the Milice effective and efficient was of it's familiarity and expertness in the battlefield it is fighting, it's volunteers spoke the same language as the rebels, it's scouts born and lived in the very land that they tread upon. Ineffective in any major offensive military operations, these units are meant for a support role at the least.
  
  * Volunteer Legion [Replaces Infantry]
  >The Volunteer Legions of Vichy France and such were widespread and credited with honour and merit in combat and warfare. Contrary to popular belief about French military prowess, the Volunteer Legions who went on to fight as Schutzstaffel Divisions in Germany and other fronts were robust and dogged in their combat ability and resistance against the enemy. One of the last Divisions to surrender in the Battle of Berlin, was the French SS Charlemagne division; evidence of sufficent military worth.
